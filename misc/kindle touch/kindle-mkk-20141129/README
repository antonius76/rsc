This file contains the combined (merged) developer keystore from this thread: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152294

All credits go to the original developers, and to PoP for packaging them together. I merely created an installer/uninstaller for them.

It also contains ixtab's Kindlet JailBreak (http://ge.tt/4wapSaK/v/92 & also available in ixtab's CM/JBpatch threads).

Basically, those are the prerequesites for running most custom Kindlets (KUAL, for example), merged in a single update package.

As always, USE THIS FILE AT YOUR OWN RISK! We won't be held responsible for evil kittens from hell and other peculiar happenings.
