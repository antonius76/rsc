To help make things clearer, you'll find here what we're now calling the *Mobileread Kindlet Kit*!

Historically, this has been known under a wealth of different dubiously helpful names (KUAL prerequisites, for example), but, basically, it's what you need to run custom Kindlets (like KUAL : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326 or Collections Manager : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=186305) on your Kindle (provided it's decently recent enough [FW >= 2.5]).


Technically, the installer package contains PoP's merged developer keystore : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152294 and ixtab's _Kindle*t*_ JailBreak : https://bitbucket.org/ixtab/kindletjailbreak (which is a different cog in the machine than the JailBreak, period), so, a round of applause for everyone involved ;)



*What Does It Do?:*

Much like the JailBreak opening a door for our stuff, this will allow you to use the custom Kindlets available on this forum.



*Latest Updates (11/29/2014):*

Minor behind the scenes changes to work in tandem with the updated bridge from the K5 1.14.N JB.



*INSTALL:*

*MKK:*

*IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR _K5_ USERS USING JAILBREAK >= v1.11.N:*

Your JB version should come with MKK bundled, meaning you can skip this post in its entirety, you're good to go :). Just make sure to reboot your device after a fresh JB install!
Note that this only applies to the *K5* (Touch/PW/PW2) JB! If you're using an older device, you will need to install MKK manually ;).







As any other hacks, your device needs to be jailbroken. Please refer to the wiki and/or the stickies & index for the appropriate method for your specific Kindle model ;).

Download the attached kindle-mkk-20141129.zip file, and unpack it. In here, you'll find a few files.
Upload the appropriate *Update_*_install.bin* file for your Kindle model to the root directory of your Kindle.
If you're confused, please refer to the Kindle nicknames list : http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Serial_Numbers on the wiki. In this specific case, the _k5_ file is indeed the one you want if you have a Touch, PW, PW2 or a KT2 or a KV.

Now, eject & unplug your Kindle, and go to *[HOME] -> [MENU] > Settings -> [MENU] > Update Your Kindle*. It should be over quickly.

Note that if you have KUAL : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326 set up and running, you're welcome to use our very own MR Package Installer : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=251143, which may speed up the process if you're installing multiple things ;).

And that's it, your Kindle is now ready to rock custom Kindlets!



*FAQs:*

*Q*. Halp! Everything is broken, and my device shows me weird popups when I try to launch a Kindlet!

*A*. You either fell victim to a silent OTA update, or you unregistered your device since the last time you tried to launch a Kindlet.
The fix is simple: reinstall MKK.
(In the case of an OTA update on a K5 device, the damage might be greater, see the JB FAQ).
